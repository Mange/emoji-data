# emoji-data

Machine-readable data files for emojis.

## Motivation, or What makes this different?

I got tired of never being able to find good reference material to use when
dealing with emojis. I want data that is:

1. Easy to update when new versions of Unicode comes out.
2. Maintained as close as possible to the source (Unicode Consortium).
3. Machine-readable in multiple formats.
4. Contains keywords / alternative names of an emoji.

I could not find any good places where all these conditions are true, so I
decided to make one myself.

## Implementation

This repo adds the official Unicode [CLDR (Common Locale Data
Repository)][cldr] data files as a submodule and then builds the data files
from the contents of those files.

Data files are built by the user when they are needed to avoid having this repo
become very large and to decrease churn of files. Still, pre-built releases are
provided via GitHub for those that only want to download the finished product.

## Usage

**tl;dr:** `make all`

### Dependencies

In order to build the data files, you'll need:

1. Ruby (2.5 or later).
2. `bundler` (Ruby gem manager) installed.
3. `jq` command-line JSON processor.

You can check your dependencies by running `make setup`. It will also install
the Ruby gems that are missing.

### Generating the data

Run `make` (or `make all`) to build all data files. You can rerun this as often
as you want; only outdated files will be rebuilt.

### List of views

Here are the current views, and an example of how they look like.

#### `all_emojis.json`

An JSON array of all emojis as objects with the following keys:

* `characters` - **String**. The Unicode characters that make up the emoji.
* `name` - **String**. The name of the emoji, or `en_tts_description` if no
  name was found.
* `category_name` - **String**. The name of the category the emoji resides in.
* `subcategory_name` - **String | `null`**. The name of the subcategory the
  emoji resides in.
* `en_keywords` - **Array<String>**. List of English keywords for the emoji.
* `en_tts_description` - **String**. The English TTS description of the emoji.
* `qualification` - **String**. Either "fully-qualified", "unqualified", or
  undetermined.

##### Sample

```json
[
  {
    "characters": "üòÇ",
    "name": "face with tears of joy",
    "category_name": "Smileys & People",
    "subcategory_name": "face-positive",
    "en_keywords": [

      "smile"
    ],
    "en_tts_description": "grinning face with big eyes",
    "qualification": "fully-qualified"
  }
]
```

#### `all_emojis.txt`

A tab-separated text file with one emoji on each line. Keywords are joined with
pipes (`|`) in the last column.

Columns are, in order:

* `characters` - The Unicode characters that make up the emoji.
* `category_name` - The name of the category the emoji resides in.
* `subcategory_name` - The name of the subcategory the emoji resides in. Can be
  empty.
* `name` - The name of the emoji, or TTS description if no name was found.
* `en_keywords` - List of English keywords for the emoji, joined with pipes
  (`|`).

E5.0  339
E11.0 188
E12.0 266
E12.1 186
E13.0 146
E13.1 422
```

#### `all.json`

Raw data of all emojis used to generate all other data files. Basic structure is this:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Category name",
      "subcategories": [
        {
          "name": "Subcategory name",
          "emojis": [
            {
              "characters": "‚Ä¶",
              "name": "name of the emoji",
              "version": "E1.0",
              "keywords": {
                "lang1": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
                "lang2": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
              },
              "tts_descriptions": {"lang1": "TTS description"},
              "qualification": "fully-qualified"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom views

You can implement custom views using `jq`. Add a file in `views` and name it
with either `.txt.jq` or `.json.jq` extensions depending on what you want.
`make` will pick up these files automatically and run it to build a file under
`data/`.
